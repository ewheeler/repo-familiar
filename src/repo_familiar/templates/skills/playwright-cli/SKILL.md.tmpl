# Playwright CLI

Use this skill when you need to inspect rendered pages, verify layout changes, capture screenshots, interact with forms, or check browser console errors.

## Typical Flow

1. Render or preview the site or app.
2. Serve the built output if needed.
3. Open a browser session and inspect the page.
4. Capture the relevant evidence: screenshot, console errors, snapshot, viewport, URL, and reproduction steps.

## Useful Commands

```bash
playwright-cli --help
playwright-cli -s=site-check open "http://127.0.0.1:5360/"
playwright-cli -s=site-check resize 1440 1000
playwright-cli -s=site-check snapshot
playwright-cli -s=site-check screenshot
playwright-cli -s=site-check console error
playwright-cli -s=site-check click <ref>
playwright-cli -s=site-check close
```

## Sessions

Use `-s=<name>` to keep a browser session alive across commands:

```bash
playwright-cli -s=site-check open "http://127.0.0.1:5360/"
playwright-cli -s=site-check goto "http://127.0.0.1:5360/docs.html"
playwright-cli -s=site-check screenshot
```

## Rules

- Prefer inspecting rendered output over guessing from source files.
- Always report the URL and viewport used for screenshots or interaction checks.
- Check console errors before declaring UI work complete.
- Do not use browser automation to bypass authentication, scrape private data, or persist secrets.
- Pair automated checks with manual review for responsive behavior, keyboard navigation, and focus states.
