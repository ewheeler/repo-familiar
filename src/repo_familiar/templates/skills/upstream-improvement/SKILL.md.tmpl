# Upstream Improvement

Use this skill when a Downstream Repository has changed generated assets, skills, profiles, docs, or advice conventions in a way that might improve the Reference Source.

## Workflow

1. Run the read-only diff:

```bash
uv run python -m repo_familiar diff-upstream-candidate --path /path/to/repo
```

2. Classify each changed asset:

- `local customization`: useful only for this Downstream Repository.
- `reusable improvement`: likely belongs in the Reference Source.
- `bug fix`: generated asset was wrong or misleading.
- `unsafe/private`: contains secrets, private paths, customer data, internal URLs, or repo-specific details.

3. For reusable changes, strip project-specific details before proposing upstream.

4. Draft a small upstream PR plan with:

- source Downstream Repository context in one sentence
- affected generated asset paths
- reason the change generalizes
- privacy/safety review result
- verification commands

5. Ask for explicit approval before creating a branch, commit, PR, or copying downstream content into the Reference Source.

## Privacy And Safety Checklist

Do not copy upstream if the change contains:

- real secrets, tokens, credentials, or private keys
- private customer, personal, child-related, or operational data
- internal hostnames, private URLs, local machine paths, or account names
- project-specific business language that is not useful as a reusable default
- instructions that weaken security, sandboxing, privacy, or access controls

If a useful lesson is mixed with private detail, rewrite it as a general pattern before proposing it upstream.

## Rules

- Keep upstream proposals small: one profile, skill, doc pattern, advice heuristic, or generated asset improvement at a time.
- Prefer a PR summary over broad code changes unless the user explicitly asks for implementation.
- Never push, open a PR, or mutate the Reference Source without explicit approval.
- Use repository docs and Bootstrap Metadata as the canonical record; memory can help recall context but should not be the source of truth.
