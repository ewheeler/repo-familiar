# Reproducibility Contract

Given committed code, configuration, the locked environment, and checksum-identified inputs, this project reproduces validated derived artifacts without network access.

## Reproduce

```bash
uv sync --frozen
uv run reproduce --check
```

The command reads `config/default.toml` and the committed synthetic fixture, then writes `artifacts/analysis.json`. Networked data acquisition must remain a separate explicit command.

## Evidence

- `data/sources.toml` records exemplar input provenance and checksum.
- `tests/test_analysis.py` asserts the known result and two-run determinism.
- `docs/tutorials.qmd` describes the same input, command, and result.
- `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` runs the required local validation gate.

## Ownership

The manifest, lockfile, source, tests, and configuration are generated starting points. Normal downstream edits are expected; repo-familiar must not refresh them automatically.
